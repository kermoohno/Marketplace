USER STORY

Jon Doe is a 16 year old teenager who wants to be a basketball player when he grows up. Mostly Joe studies alot to get a scholarship so he could go to a great college and become a proffesional basketball player but sometimes he also likes to play a game called Albion Online. Albion Online has a market system where players can sell and buy items but for every item listed to be sold has the seller to pay ingame tax which could be a pretty hefty amount depending on the item's value.

Joe can just create his own market by using this application he can go to localhost:3000 and do everything from there he can add items to sale without having to pay ingame tax and other people can view these items and when they want to buy something they can contact Joe and they can just do a trade ingame so Joe is not losing any money by paying taxes. (Ofcourse he would have to create a live website for others to see the page)


APPLICATION USAGE

Feel free to setup this application on you're machine i don't mind it at all just install the necessary dependencies(you can see what i used under "USED TECHNOLOGIES") and go to localhost:3000.
